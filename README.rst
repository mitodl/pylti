PyLTI is a Python implementation of the LTI specification [#f1]_.  It supports
LTI 1.1.1 and LTI 2.0.  While it was written with edX [#f2]_ as its LTI consumer, it
is a complete implementation of the LTI specification and can be used with any
learning management system that supports LTI.

A feature of PyLTI is the way it is used in the creation of an LTI tool.  PyLTI
is written as a library that exposes an API.  This separation of concerns
enables a developer to focus on the business logic of their tool and support of
their framework of choice.

To demonstrate this usage, there are also a collection of example LTI tools
written to support different Python web frameworks.
